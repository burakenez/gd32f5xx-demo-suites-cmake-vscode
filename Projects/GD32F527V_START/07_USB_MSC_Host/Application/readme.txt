  This demo is based on the GD32F527V-START-V1.0 board, and it provides a description of how 
to use the USBFS/USBHS host peripheral on the GD32F5xx devices.

  The GD32F5xx devices behave as a mass storage Host that can enumerate, show content 
and write file in the attached USB flash disk.

  If an Udisk has been attached, the user will see the information of Udisk enumeration. 
First pressing the Wakeup key will see the Udisk information, and the root content of the 
Udisk, and then the application will write file to the Udisk, finally the user will see 
the information that the MSC host demo is end.

   The USART is used to show the print message through HyperTerminal. Please open the HyperTerminal 
and connect the USART to the PC through the serial port line.
