  This demo is based on the GD32F527I-EVAL-V1.0 board, it shows how to use RCU clock out function. 
When program is running, user could press the tamper key to select different clock output mode.
Demo has three clock output mode. Once the key is pressed, the next mode will be selected and 
corresponding led will light. Debug information can be printed from USART by using USART0. The
clock output pins are configured PA8 and PC9. 
  The JP21 should be jumped to USART.
